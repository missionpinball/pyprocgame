.. module:: procgame.LEDs

The LEDs module is used to control LEDs connected to a PD-LED driver board. It contains several classes and methods which allow LED shows, scripts, commands, priorities, fades, and all sorts of things. Full instructions and an overview are available on the `PinballControllers.com wiki <http://www.pinballcontrollers.com/wiki/Controlling_LEDs_with_the_PD-LED_board>`_. The documentation here is meant to be more of a reference guide.

Current status is beta. Please post to the `Drive Boards forum at PinballControllers.com<http://www.pinballcontrollers.com/forum/index.php?board=16.0>`_ with questions.

This documentation could also be thought of as "beta". There are lots of things to clean up.
